#FaceDecision: A Mobile QoS-based Deep Learning Framework for Face Detection

CMU 2019 Spring 18-859 Group Project



### Overview

In this project, we extend the use case of DeepDesicion to the face detection task and propose new utility functions and algorithm. We make experiments on 6 models located on local or remote and analyze utilities changing with user preferences and variables. Under different network conditions, our approach is effective to select the best model for users.
